## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd face-detection-recognition
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your raw images or videos in the `data/raw` directory.

## Usage Guidelines

- To run the application, execute the following command:
  ```
  python src/main.py
  ```

- The application will initialize video capture and display the detected and recognized faces in real-time.

## Overview of Functionality

- **Face Detection**: The system detects faces in images or video frames using a pre-trained model.
- **Face Recognition**: Detected faces are recognized by comparing them against a database of known individuals.
- **Utilities**: Various utility functions assist in image preprocessing and visualization.
