```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-ids
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the network traffic data using `data_preprocessing.py`.
2. Train the anomaly detection model using `model_training.py`.
3. Use `anomaly_detection.py` to fit the model and predict anomalies in the network traffic data.
4. Explore the data and results using the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks` directory.
